#  Task 2: Phishing Email Analysis - Cyber Security Internship

##  Sample Phishing Email Summary

This phishing email pretends to be from PayPal and tries to scare the user into clicking a fake link and submitting personal information. Below are the clear phishing indicators.

---

##  Phishing Indicators Identified

1. **Suspicious Sender Email:**  
   `noreply.paypal@securemygateway.com` — This is not an official PayPal domain. Real PayPal emails come from `@paypal.com`.

2. **Urgent/Threatening Language:**  
   The email claims that the PayPal account is "temporarily restricted" due to suspicious activity, creating a false sense of urgency.

3. **Fake Login Button:**  
   The "Log in to Paypal" button is likely a phishing link that could steal login credentials.

4. **Request for Sensitive Info:**  
   Asks for personal documents to "confirm identity" — a common tactic used by attackers to commit identity theft.

5. **Generic Greeting:**  
   It starts with "Dear Customer" instead of using the actual name. Legitimate PayPal emails usually address the user by full name.

6. **Spelling/Grammar Errors:**  
   The sentence: "You must confirm your identity to confirm that you own the credit card" is awkward and repetitive — a typical sign of phishing.

7. **Email Format and Branding:**  
   While it mimics PayPal branding, the link and domain don't match real PayPal properties.
